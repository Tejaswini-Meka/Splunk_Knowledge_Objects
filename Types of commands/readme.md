### Types of commands

There are six broad categorizations for almost all of the search commands:

- distributable streaming
- centralized streaming
- transforming
- generating
- orchestrating
- dataset processing</br>

These categorizations are not mutually exclusive. Some commands fit into only one categorization. The stats command is an example of a command that fits only into the transforming categorization. Other commands can fit into multiple categorizations. For example a command can be streaming and also generating.</br>
