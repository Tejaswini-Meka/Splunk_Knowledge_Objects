# Field-Aliases-Calculated-Fields

### Field-Aliases
A field alias is an alternate name that can be assigned to a field. Field aliases can be used to normalize data from multiple sources, and to assign different extracted field names to a single field name.

use: field name normalization across the data.

Example see the below data, which is having the common field 

![data4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43aa80e-8d6e-469d-8b53-3f64e7980c9b)

Now i want to see the results of all types of usernames field values under single filed (user)</br>
In this case *rename* command wont work</br>
Because, we cannot rename the multiple fields with the same name.

Now we have to use the below configurations in **props.conf** wrt to application and sourcetype
![data5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3faf3d58-1445-48b6-bb1c-6b1ec170a76f)

![image (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cda1924-6957-45b4-be33-d4f33f8f41d5)

After this we can see the field **user** under this we can get the values of all types of usernames.


### Calculated-Fields

![data1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8dcdba8-7ae9-46fe-a05a-cb44d4c46a46)

The above query is having the calculated fields.
Same results i want it in each and every results without writing the qurey everytime.
In this scenario, calculated fields comes to the picture.

In above query calculated fields are</br>
```
| eval discount_in_number = MRP - 'Selling Price'
| eval discount_in_perc = round((discount_in_number/MRP)*100)
```
If you see the above query, field **discount_in_perc** rely on **discount_in_number**
it can give the results in search time but same cannot be applicable in props.conf - calculated field cannot reliably depend on another is due to Splunkâ€™s independent and non-sequential calculation of fields in props.conf. Each calculated field should rely on raw data, not on the results of other calculated fields

Now we have to mentioned them in **props.conf** file of the respective application and sourcetype.
Below is the configuration we have to do it in props.conf
```
EVAL-discount_in_number = MRP - 'Selling Price'
EVAL-discount_in_perc = round((MRP - 'Selling Price')*100)
```
![Data2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b612c520-0d0f-4202-8421-b6a7f744dd3e)

Now without mentioning the *eval* command in the query directly we can get the results of our calculated fields **"discount_in_number"** & **"discount_in_perc"**
